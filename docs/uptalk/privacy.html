      <p>
        Uptalk does not track you. It collects no analytics. Your data is stored locally, and synced to your devices
        using your personal iCloud. It is not stored on Uptalk's servers.
      <p>

      <p>
        If you explicitly make a report via the Uptalk UI, that report will be uploaded and saved to Uptalk's servers.
      <p>

      <p>
        Various Uptalk features are implemented using the OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude API, Azure AI Translator,
        and Azure AI Speech. All of these services are committed to not using your data for training AIs, but they do
        retain data in some cases. For more information, see the

        The App Store has a setting to provide limited, anonymized analytics information to Apple, some of which is
        made available to developers. See the <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/app-store/">App Store
          Privacy Policy</a> for more information.

        This privacy policy may be altered and amended within reason from time to time to reflect the evolving
        nature of the software. By using Uptalk, you agree to this privacy policy.
